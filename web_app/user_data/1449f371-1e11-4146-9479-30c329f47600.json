It usually opens 24 to 48 hours before the flight.\n\n4. **Luggage**: Ensure your luggage meets the airline's size and weight restrictions for both carry-on and checked baggage.\n\n5. **Identification**: Carry necessary identification and travel documents. For international travels, passports are required, and a visa might be necessary depending on your destination.\n\n6. **Security Screening**: Prepare for security screening by limiting liquids in carry-on bags, removing large electronics from luggage before scanning, and wearing easily removable shoes.\n\n7. **Flight Information**: Keep updated with your flight status for any delays or changes, usually available on the airline's website or mobile application.\n\n8. **In-flight Policy**: Familiarize yourself with in-flight safety procedures and regulations, including seatbelt policies and electronic device usage rules.\n\nIf you need specific information about Swiss Airlines or certain policies, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further!",

However, generally speaking, status customers like HON Circle Members, Senators, and Frequent Travellers may have specific considerations and benefits when choosing a fare, such as:\n\n1. **Mileage Accumulation**: Some fares offer more miles than others. Status customers may want to choose fares that maximize their mileage accumulation.\n\n2. **Lounge Access**: While lounge access is typically a benefit based on status, certain fares might offer enhanced lounge privileges.\n\n3. **Upgrade Eligibility**: Certain fares might be more favorable for upgrades. It's wise to check which fare classes are eligible for using miles or vouchers for upgrades.\n\n4. **Baggage Allowance**: Status holders often have additional baggage allowances, but it’s always good to confirm that your chosen fare aligns with your luggage needs.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: Status customers often receive enhanced rebooking or cancellation conditions, but some fare types may offer additional flexibility.\n\n6. **Priority Services**: Ensure your fare includes or complements your priority check-in, boarding, and baggage handling entitlements.\n\nFor precise fare options and benefits, it would be advisable to consult Swiss Airlines directly through their website or customer service.
